1.) First I performed text analytics on DonaldTrump.txt and hillaryClinton.txt which consists of their biography. I found most common words used in both txt files and 
compared them using nltk tools. 

2.) After completing previous step I also created CSV files namely, "DonaldTrump_common_500_words.csv", "hillaryClinton_common_500_words.csv", and 
"distinctiveWords.csv" which consists of relative frequeuncy of specific word in both txt files.

3.) Lastly I performed sentiment Analysis on tweets.csv file which consists of tweets from Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton during their election in 2016.
